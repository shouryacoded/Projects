In case of optimsized bubble sort we use a flag element that indicates that sorting is taking place in a traversal of a array . If in a case were use bubble sort to sort the array which is already sorted, the traversal will only take place once as the flag remain 'false' after the first traversal. Since, flag remains as 'false' there will no other traversal of the loop, and algorithm will break out of the loop and the sorting will be complete. Thus if after a iteration in array the algorithm will break of the loop using a break statement.
